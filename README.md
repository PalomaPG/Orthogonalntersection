# Orthogonal Segment Intersection Search

A Java implementation of the search of orthogonal segment intersection given a segments set. This program includes the possibility to generate the sets according to the distribution of the first X coordinate: it could be gaussian or uniformly distributed. 

## Getting Started

There are more than one way to run this program. The followings are...

a) Cloning the repo...

- Clone this repository on your machine and load it as an Eclipse project.
- Inside the project, select Run Configuration
- Choose the Main tab, and configure the project as: OrthogonalIntersection, and Main class as main.Main
- In Arguments tab, just give the program one of the following input:
      
       * -e : execute the program using the data already created 
       * -g : generate all the sets



### Prerequisites

This program was implemented in Java 8, so you need to install, in case you don't have it, this version on your Eclipse Editor or machine.
